# Usage

Refer to [Simulate Scenario documentation](https://github.com/fortinet-fortisoar/solution-pack-soc-simulator/blob/develop/docs/usage.md) to understand how to simulate and reset scenarios.

To understand the process FortiSOAR follows to manage vulnerabilities, we have included a scenario &mdash; **Vulnerability Management** &mdash; with this solution pack.

Refer to the section *Vulnerability Management* to understand how this solution pack's automation addresses your needs.

## Vulnerability Management

This scenario generates an example asset, scan, and some vulnerabilities.

Navigate to the generated scan and note the following:

The scan contains the following information

- Scan state
- Scan duration
- User's email address
- Asset details as a record

Navigate to the generated asset, within the scan, and note the following:

- Reported Asset contains the following among other information
    - Host Name
    - IP Address
    - MAC Address
    - Operating System
- Select the asset record to view the following information about the reported asset
    - Asset's Operating System
    - Asset's State
    - Asset's Status
    - Asset's Criticality

Navigate to the generated vulnerabilities and note the following about the scanned asset:

- Severity
- Status
- Risk and Risk score
- Exploits
- Exploit Skills

You can open each vulnerability to read Description, Synopsis, and proposed Solution for each.

Users can launch the **Get Vulnerability Details** playbook. This playbook performs the following automated tasks:

- Identifying severity of the vulnerability
- Finding vulnerability count
- Getting synopsis, solution, plugin details, risk information and reference information.
